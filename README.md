### Base :
The base in a delta 3D printer is the platform that provides stability and support. It consists of three vertical towers connected by horizontal beams and holds components like motors and pulleys. It ensures the printer remains stable and allows for precise movements of the print head.

### Holder :
A holder in a delta 3D printer is a component or structure that holds and supports different parts of the printer. Examples include the carriage holder for the print head, endstop holder for sensors, filament holder for the spool, and belt holders for securing belts and pulleys.

### Rod :
In a delta 3D printer, rods are cylindrical components that enable precise movement and positioning. Vertical rods provide structural support, while horizontal rods allow for smooth horizontal movement. Tower rods connect the carriages or effector assembly and determine the printer's range of movement. Together, these rods enable accurate positioning of the print head for detailed prints.

### Top cover :
A top cover in a delta 3D printer is a protective structure that covers the upper part of the printer. It provides protection from dust and debris, helps regulate temperature, reduces noise, enhances safety, and can improve the printer's appearance.

### Top Cover Frame :
A top cover frame in a delta 3D printer is a sturdy structure that supports and secures the top cover. It provides stability, protects internal components, and contributes to the printer's aesthetics.

Linear Rail :
A linear rail in a delta 3D printer is a motion system that replaces traditional linear bearings and rods. It consists of a rail with rollers or balls and a carriage that moves along the rail. Linear rails provide increased stability, higher load capacity, improved precision, lower friction, and durability compared to traditional linear bearings. They enable smooth and precise movement of components like the print head or print bed carriage.

### Motor :
Motors in a delta 3D printer drive the mechanical movements and control various components. Stepper motors enable precise positioning of the towers, carriages, and print head. The extruder motor feeds filament, while cooling fan motors dissipate heat. Motorized filament spool holders ensure smooth filament feeding. They are controlled by the printer's electronics and firmware for synchronized movements.

### Base :
In a delta 3D printer, the base is the stable and supportive structure that holds the printer's components together. It consists of three vertical towers in a triangular formation, connected by horizontal beams. The base ensures stability during operation and enables precise movement of the print head.

### Bed :
In a delta 3D printer, the bed is the flat surface where the object being printed is placed. It provides stability and adhesion for the printed layers. Some beds can be heated to improve print quality and minimize warping. Proper leveling of the bed ensures accurate printing.

### Slide with Connector :
A slide with connector in a delta 3D printer is a component or mechanism that allows for smooth sliding or linear movement and has a connector interface for attaching other parts.

### Connecting Rods :
Connecting rods in a delta 3D printer are adjustable rods that link the carriages or effector assembly to the vertical and horizontal rods. They enable precise movement and help maintain alignment for accurate printing.

### Extruder :
The extruder in a delta 3D printer feeds and controls the filament during printing. It consists of a motor, filament drive mechanism, and guides the filament into the hot end for melting and deposition.

### Pins :
In a delta 3D printer, pins are small metal components used for various purposes, such as endstop switches, electrical connectors, or guide pins for alignment and stabilization.

### Motor with Gear :
A motor with gear in a delta 3D printer is a combination of a stepper motor and a gear mechanism. It is commonly used in the extruder assembly to control filament feeding by providing precise movement and increased torque.

### LCD :
The LCD in a delta 3D printer is a display that shows important information and enables user interaction. It provides details about print progress, temperatures, settings, and allows users to navigate menus, adjust options, and control the printer.
